부시를 풍자하는 내용의 플래시입니다. 중간부분에 꽤 재미있는 내용도 나오고, 몇부분은 알아듣겠으나 모르는게 너무 많네요.  
  
혹시나 블로거님들 중에 **해석**해 주시면 댓글이나 트랙백 날려 주심 감사하겠습니다~! ㅋ

SECOND TERM!  
  
(To the tune of “She’ll Be Coming Around the Mountain When She Comes”)  
  
Yes, I’m comin’ back to serve a second term.  
This time I won the national elec-she-un!  
Oh, thanks to you O-hi-a,  
And dear brother Jebedia,  
We get four more years to rule in Washington!  
  
Good God he’s comin’ back to serve a second term.  
We were hoping in ’04 we’d get a turn.  
But we lost the vicious battle,  
Now they’re stuck without a paddle!  
Who will save us from con-ser-va-tiz-eum?  
  
I will stabalize Iraq in my second term.  
And I will amend the con-sti-tu-sheun.  
Then I’ll eliminate all the taxes,  
That are breakin; all our back-siz.  
And push for more pri-vat-i-za-she-un!  
  
We cannot believe he won a second term.  
He destroyed the trans-atlantic alli-unce!  
Heck, I’ll extend a friendly offer,  
Barbeque and beers in Crawford!  
Mending fences broken by pre-emp-she-un!  
  
We want peace on earth throughout his second term.  
We want Iraqis to have free elec-she-uns.  
There’s a beef here, let’s dispatch it,  
And bury that ol’ hatchet.  
  
Yes, we’ve been through stormy weather,  
Now it’s time to work together!  
Gather round the ol’ chuck wagon,  
It’s a grand time we’ll be havin’,  
In the four years he has left in Wash-ing-ton!
